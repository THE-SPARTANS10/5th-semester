Appendix:English palindromes
Jump to navigationJump to search
This appendix lists palindromes in English.

This list includes some proper names, hyphenated words and archaic words, as well as some names and words of foreign origin. The primary criterion for inclusion here is that the word is listed in one or more of the dictionaries or encyclopedias referenced by the OneLook dictionary search. However, some entries have been included on the basis of plausible evidence from other websites, or the application of living prefixes or suffixes (such as -er, meaning agent). Surnames are excluded. Some place names have also been omitted on the grounds of being too obscure..
