1.task ids are important to show precedence relation
2.different task precedence relation:-
->finish to start:-after termination of first job , second job should start
->start to finish
->start to start
->finish to finish

3.why the task are coloured red in gant chart:
->to represent critical task w.r.t software

->CRITICAL TASK:- Tasks that cannot be delayed without affecting the project finish date are the critical task

4.gant chart are used to represent the task graphicaly along with the starting and finishing time 

->M1[4] -> M1 Resource need 4 units

5. expected time=(to+4*tm+tp)/6
to=optimistic time,tp=pessimistic time,tm=most likely time

6.Meaning of forward schedule in project libre
 
7.what is SRS?
->SRS or Software Requirement Study , it is a well written document which contains all requirement of customer

8.what is coupling and cohesion?

9.what is DFD?

10 what is task dependency and predecessors in project libre ??

11. what is critical activity?

12.what is CPM?

13.which model is known as meta model ?
->spiral because it conatins fetaures of others models

14.what is PERT and optimistic,pessimistic and most likely time?
->programme evaluation review training

15.what is black box and white box testing ?.

16.what is cfg?(cfg formula)

17.what is used case diagram?

18. what is recurrent task?

19. definition gant chart?

20.need of task ids?
